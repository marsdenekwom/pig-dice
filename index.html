  <h1>RULES OF PIG DICE</h1>

  <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
   <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
   <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
   <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
</ul>
